How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I found a typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    when a mistake is made, it makes it easier to go back to a working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can break the text up into workable pieces
	Cons: I could lose a large chunk of work or end up with too large of a change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Computer programs are interactions of several files, while docs are by and 
	large stand alone files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use the log to find the commit with the changes you seek, then use diff 
	to compare that with the previous commit to see what changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know with version control I can always go back to a working version of the
	program.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    retrieve code from github and compare commits, and get better control of my
