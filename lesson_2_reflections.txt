How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	the working directory is the folder in the computer, but the staging area is 
	a unique set of files to work on. this allows you to operate on a set that 
	is smaller than the directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	as you work on one logical change, add those files to the staging area
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	branches for new features while you test them to make sure they work. branches
	allow the program to exist in an unaltered state while you make changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	it's easier to see how commits relate to each other
